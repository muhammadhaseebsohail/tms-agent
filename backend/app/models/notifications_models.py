The code provided includes the necessary Pydantic models for the request and response. The `NotificationBase` model is used as a base model for creating and reading notifications, it includes `task_id`, `user_id` and `message`. The `NotificationCreate` model extends `NotificationBase` and is used for creating a new notification. 

The `Notification` model also extends `NotificationBase` and is used for reading notifications, it includes additional fields `id`, `read` and `created_at` that are not required when creating a notification.

Here is an overview of the models:

1. `NotificationBase`: Used as a base model for creating and reading notifications.

```python
class NotificationBase(BaseModel):
    task_id: int
    user_id: int
    message: str
```

2. `NotificationCreate`: Extends `NotificationBase`. Used for creating a new notification.

```python
class NotificationCreate(NotificationBase):
    pass
```

3. `Notification`: Extends `NotificationBase`. Used for reading notifications. Includes additional fields `id`, `read` and `created_at`.

```python
class Notification(NotificationBase):
    id: int
    read: bool
    created_at: datetime

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

There are no additional data transfer objects required for the provided code. The `NotificationCreate` model is used as a data transfer object to send data from the client to the server when creating a new notification, and the `Notification` model is used as a data transfer object to send data from the server to the client when reading notifications.
